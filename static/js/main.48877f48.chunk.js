Special thanks to WriteAnon, <a href="https://tmblr.co/m2pdxIkGJfug6j7Xy6l78Iw">@trashsavage</a>, and VrBit for all their help in writing and editing, as well as <a href="https://tmblr.co/mWGiMCEDqxEPzQuGo4wM8nw">@zooijiness</a>, <a href="https://tmblr.co/mi-WzlQuxz9NIxxUATLbRxw">@eightspartans</a> and Rose for all their input on the art. You guys are great!</p><p>And of course the fans! I dunno if I&rsquo;d have kept the motivation to finish this huge project without the encouragement of everyone on /trash/ and here on tublrmar. I also need to give thanks to all those that gave their unfiltered and withering critique online. Tragedy porn indeed! I learned a lot about storytelling making this and, while you might not see it, in the end the series was much better for it.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, it&rsquo;s very unlikely the series would have reached nearly as many without the early reblogs by @nicolaswildes, so special mention to him or her (they?) as well! Keep up your good work, dude(tte)!</p><p>EDIT: Holy moly, I accidentally cut out a panel on the second page! It&rsquo;s added back in now, though I guess it says something about the clunky pacing that nobody noticed..</p></p>',is_current_item:!0,is_root_item:!0}],photoset_layout:"1333",photos:[{caption:"",original_size:{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_1280.jpg",width:900,height:621},alt_sizes:[{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_1280.jpg",width:900,height:621},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_640.jpg",width:640,height:442},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_540.jpg",width:540,height:373},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_500.jpg",width:500,height:345},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_400.jpg",width:400,height:276},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_250.jpg",width:250,height:173},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_100.jpg",width:100,height:69},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9e9f33bede4e46575d4fd6b9767902c3/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o1_75sq.jpg",width:75,height:75}]},{caption:"",original_size:{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1639},alt_sizes:[{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1639},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_640.jpg",width:527,height:960},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_540.jpg",width:445,height:810},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_500.jpg",width:412,height:750},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_400.jpg",width:329,height:600},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_250.jpg",width:220,height:400},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_100.jpg",width:100,height:182},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/c882964b751130a4b632c293dfb66e29/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o2_r2_75sq.jpg",width:75,height:75}]},{caption:"",original_size:{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1626},alt_sizes:[{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1626},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_640.jpg",width:531,height:960},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_540.jpg",width:448,height:810},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_500.jpg",width:415,height:750},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_400.jpg",width:332,height:600},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_250.jpg",width:221,height:400},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_100.jpg",width:100,height:181},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/995f9b6200afedad2820362b996399c9/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o3_75sq.jpg",width:75,height:75}]},{caption:"",original_size:{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1092},alt_sizes:[{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1092},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_640.jpg",width:640,height:777},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_540.jpg",width:540,height:655},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_500.jpg",width:500,height:607},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_400.jpg",width:400,height:485},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_250.jpg",width:250,height:303},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_100.jpg",width:100,height:121},{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b5c21dd21375b1e217f101c78474b6a/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o4_75sq.jpg",width:75,height:75}]},{caption:"",original_size:{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/71ad80a6cfe833c03ee00e85acbd7ab0/tumblr_oeht8xuBTq1vv1t26o5_1280.jpg",width:900,height:1639},alt_sizes:[{url:"https://64.media.tumblr.com/71ad80a6cfe833c03ee00e8

hall, her heavy Preyda purse bumped against her hip in time with her slow, casual stride, her security entourage followed closely behind her as she strode through the doorway and onto the field. Swinton couldn&rsquo;t help but gawk; the Oasis Stadium, a massive structure designed to seat a respectable percentage of the city&rsquo;s population, was bustling with countless citizens and visitors. Reflexively she smiled and waved, but was greeted not with cheers, but ire as the massive crowd burst into a hissing, angry buzz, a jostled hornet&rsquo;s nest of indignant mammals. There was little she could make out, but the overall message was clear, this crowd was only a precious few increments away from storming the field and stringing her up from the nearest street lamp.</i><br/></p><hr><p><i>Boy, </i>this chapter and the next few strips turned out to be much more divisive than I had anticipated. A lot of people seem upset with the shift in tone that we\u2019ll see for a little while going forward&hellip; Well, I hope you\u2019ll just stick with me despite it all, if nothing else I\u2019ve had a great time working on these next few comics, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really important to me <i>so there! </i></p><p>If you\u2019re curious about what all the hubbub is about then keep reading under the cut, but do keep in mind that this won\u2019t make much sense if you haven\u2019t been following <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/7451746?view_full_work=true">the Swinton sidestory!</a></p>\x3c!-- more --\x3e<p><i>      </i>   \u201cAll these repressed urges I&rsquo;m sensing,\u201d<i> Swinton sneered as she approached the podium, already sweating under the blazing Sahara sun. </i>\u201cHolding it all in, it can&rsquo;t be healthy. Well, I suppose Marshal&rsquo;s botanical pursuits are about to pay off, hmm? If I can&rsquo;t make the people love me, I can make them hate everyone else a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p><i>         Swinton set her hands down on the podium, sipping from a glass of mineral water laid out for her. She cleared her throat and spoke into the mic. \u201cAssembled citizens of Zootopia, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for allowing me to address this most esteemed event in light of more recent controversy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The crowd bellowed, the teeming mass in the bleachers began to wave signs and effigies of her, some of which had already burst into flame. Swinton gave no indication that the display had affected her and continued. \u201cI will make no attempt to deny the veracity of the recording, nor will I comment on the charges brought against me, I would simply like to reiterate: thank you for permitting me to address you, all of you, the tens of thousands of you who attended this event, thank you. You\u2026idiots.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The crowd&rsquo;s angry buzz died down, if she squinted, she could see them turning to one another, questioning if they had heard correctly.</i></p><p><i>         Swinton chuckled, smiling winsomely. \u201cYou heard me. Look at you, all of you, you despise me and yet you came out to jeer. You don&rsquo;t know how happy I am that your spiteful, petty urges got the better of you and brought you here, to me, so that I can tell you this: the only thing I regret is the fact that I had to peddle and pander to you imbeciles to get into power. Getting elected is the worst part of politics by far, if only because it means I have to pretend that you things are my equals, to give speeches not one of you creatures comprehends, much less appreciates! Democracy is a vanity project for idiots, to make even dregs such as yourselves feel that your existence is validated. Well, how does it feel, Zootopia? You put me up here, you cast the ballots, and in record numbers! How does it feel, knowing that you voted for monster like me? That I, for years on end, had each and every one of your petty, puerile opinions wrapped around my finger?\u201d The crowd was silent, shocked, Swinton continued. \u201cNothing to say? That&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t need to say anything. All you need to do is sit there and stew in the knowledge that I&rsquo;m going to get away and that you&rsquo;re going to help me. I played you, Zootopia; I played you like a harp from hell. But now the song&rsquo;s over, so enjoy the encore.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Swinton raised her arms and grinned, all around the stadium dozens upon dozens of enormous confetti balloons began to inflate. The crowd murmured in alarm as they rose into the air, position themselves directly above the bleachers, several hundred feet over their heads. The balloons tumbled and gyred as they rose, their distended forms filled with millions upon millions of tiny blue pellets mixed in with the ribbons of string and tabs of paper.</i></p><p><i>         A cry went out and the attendees flinched simultaneously as one of the balloons burst with a thunderous crack, disappearing in a cloud swirling red, white, and blue. Amidst the fluttering debris, millions of murderous pellets the size of BBs streaked out of the sky onto the people below, peppering them with splotches of cerulean jelly. Those affected blinked in confusion for a moment, dabbing the substances dotting their bodies with their fingers. More than a few sniffed the goo, swirling it around between their fingers. Then, they began to twitch. A few spasms at first, but soon the bleachers were a sea of apoplexy and contorting bodies. As the poison took hold, many found themselves gasping for air as their heart rates skyrocketed, a jittery rush of adrenaline followed by an overwhelming surge of horror. Unbidden, a deep bestial rage seized them, their cries of alarm and fear fast becoming horrible, livid bellows of hate and fury.</i></p><p><i>         Those surrounding them began to shriek in terror as the now savage animals teemed forth and sunk their teeth, claws, and horns into those around them. In succession, the rest of the balloons burst, dousing mammals by the tens of thousands. Swinton\u2019s entourage formed a protective circle around her as screaming savages swarmed out of the bleachers and onto the field, their paws tearing up the sod. She sniffed disinterestedly as she ambled towards the exit.</i></p><p><i>         \u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d Stevens bellowed, his sidearm drawn. \u201cGet out of here, we\u2019ll hold them off!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cYes,\u201d Swinton chuckled airily, drawing an airgun from her purse. \u201cYou will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Six the weapon hissed and her six guards lurched forward, clutching their necks. Swinton hurried towards the exit and pulled the door shut behind her.</i> \u201cA bit of a gamble, but I\u2019m willing to bet that if a savage tiger sees a bunch of enraged animals bearing down on him, he\u2019s not going to notice the pig behind him. Those six ought to keep that lot off the door out of sheer territoriality, and more effectively, too.\u201d</p><p><i>         A deafening roar rumbled through the door, sounds of carnage and battle raged from the other side. </i>\u201cSee? Come on, then. We\u2019ve got a chopper to get to.\u201d</p><p><i>         By the time she reached the helipad, the pilot was already halfway through the take-off sequence; the deafening whir of the copter blades as they whirled through the air only served to backdrop the undulating feral roars permeating the Oasis. Swinton rushed over to the door and leapt in, pulling on her flight helmet. \u201cParker! You coward, you were going to leave without me!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The pilot snapped around and looked at her, his eyes wide. \u201cMayor Swinton! What the hell is going on out there?! There was this group of animals that came nowhere! The guards you left here, they\u2026\u201d he swallowed thickly, as though the memory alone nauseated him. \u201cI managed to scare them off by turning on the chopper, I wasn\u2019t going to leave without you, I promise!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cShut up and take off!\u201d Swinton bellowed, buckling herself in.</i></p><p><i>         The helicopter lurched into the air as the engine thundered anew. The small, nimble craft gimbaled through the sky over the stadium, Swinton looked out at her handiwork; writhing throngs of animals poured out of the stadium and into the surrounding city, attacking all they saw. \u201cHm. That should keep Wilde busy for a few hours while I procure my bugout kit. What\u2019s that? Oh, I always knew it would come to this, one way or another, so I have a few articles that have all I need to start fresh in another city; a few million dollars, a fake passport, the names and numbers of the best forgers and plastic surgeons, the whole nine. I just have to get to my penthouse first.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The helicopter circled and began its descent above a lavish, hillside mansion. It settled on the rooftop helipad, before the chopper had even settled, Swinton had hopped out and was scampering across the flat plateau and towards the door. She clambered down the stairs and hurried into her spacious, tastefully appointed living room. She turned on the TV and selected the news channel. Already reports of the deluge of savages was pouring in, with footage of panicked crowds and roving packs of Gerald dragging down and mauling those unable to escape. Swinton heaved a sigh of relief, Marshal had managed to cook up a batch strong enough to overcome any and all sense of self-preservation, the city was now infested with nearly a hundred thousand rabid beasts. The odds of them being able to spare enough cops to take her in was just about nil. </i></p><p><i>         Just as well, she had made quite the speech and put on bit of a show back there. &ldquo;What can I say, I have a flair for the dramatic.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         She strode into her palatial room, the red satin bedsheets shone dimly in the soft light emanating from her chandelier. Swinton sighed and looked around at her possessions, off the top of her head she estimated that between the furniture and jewelry that there was something on the order of a million dollars in that room alone. She relented; it was only money, after all.</i></p><p><i>         &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need much,&rdquo; she said, sighing. &ldquo;Never have. I simply like to have the best. I suppose that indulgence is what led to all this\u2026&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         A low, sighing hiss from behind drew her attention to the door, she spun around to see a large, serpentine form slither into view. &ldquo;My, but you&rsquo;ve made a mess out there, hmmm?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         Swinton loosed a shuddering breath, her heart thundering in her chest. &ldquo;Eunectes! What are you doing here?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         The snake&rsquo;s massive head lifted up off the floor, her body slithered onward slowly in a seemingly endless coil. &ldquo;Those people at the stadium, they were no threat to you. They were not your enemies or rivals, yet you poisoned them, set them to kill their neighbors, your citizens, your fellow mammals.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         &ldquo;I never took you for the sentimental type, Your Excellency,&rdquo; Swinton sneered as she opened her closet and pulled out a suitcase filled with bank bonds.</i></p><p><i>         &ldquo;Your actions confuse me, is all,&rdquo; Eunectes said, her front quarter rearing up off the ground, her head brushing the 8-foot ceiling. &ldquo;In Herpetopia, a failure such as yours is met with death, and those responsible are obliged to either accept their failure or find the weak link in the operation and dispose of it.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         Swinton snorted hauled the suitcase across the room towards the door. &ldquo;I guess your fancy snekway doesn&rsquo;t have a GPS, otherwise you&rsquo;d have realized that we&rsquo;re not in your horrid country! Now, the way I see it, you need me to get away!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         &ldquo;Do I, now?&rdquo; the giant snake rumbled. &ldquo;Oh, by all means, elaborate.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>         &ldquo;If I go down, you go down! I&rsquo;ll squeal, to the cops, to Interpol, to anyone who will listen! You will be complicit in this clusterfuck, and even if you have diplomatic immunity, I don&rsquo;t imagine relations between our nations will continue long afterwards! Ties will break down and you&rsquo;ll be responsible, in the eyes of your peers and your Empress! How long do you think you&rsquo;ll last with that hanging over your head?&rdquo; Swinton spun around to glare at her uninvited guest, only to almost walk into Eunectes&rsquo; reared up body.

Look at you, all of you, you despise me and yet you came out to jeer. You don\u2019t know how happy I am that your spiteful, petty urges got the better of you and brought you here, to me, so that I can tell you this: the only thing I regret is the fact that I had to peddle and pander to you imbeciles to get into power. Getting elected is the worst part of politics by far, if only because it means I have to pretend that you things are my equals, to give speeches not one of you creatures comprehends, much less appreciates! Democracy is a vanity project for idiots, to make even dregs such as yourselves feel that your existence is validated. Well, how does it feel, Zootopia? You put me up here, you cast the ballots, and in record numbers! How does it feel, knowing that you voted for monster like me? That I, for years on end, had each and every one of your petty, puerile opinions wrapped around my finger?\u201d The crowd was silent, shocked, Swinton continued. \u201cNothing to say? That\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need to say anything. All you need to do is sit there and stew in the knowledge that I\u2019m going to get away and that you\u2019re going to help me. I played you, Zootopia; I played you like a harp from hell. But now the song\u2019s over, so enjoy the encore.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Swinton raised her arms and grinned, all around the stadium dozens upon dozens of enormous confetti balloons began to inflate. The crowd murmured in alarm as they rose into the air, position themselves directly above the bleachers, several hundred feet over their heads. The balloons tumbled and gyred as they rose, their distended forms filled with millions upon millions of tiny blue pellets mixed in with the ribbons of string and tabs of paper.</i></p><p><i>         A cry went out and the attendees flinched simultaneously as one of the balloons burst with a thunderous crack, disappearing in a cloud swirling red, white, and blue. Amidst the fluttering debris, millions of murderous pellets the size of BBs streaked out of the sky onto the people below, peppering them with splotches of cerulean jelly. Those affected blinked in confusion for a moment, dabbing the substances dotting their bodies with their fingers. More than a few sniffed the goo, swirling it around between their fingers. Then, they began to twitch. A few spasms at first, but soon the bleachers were a sea of apoplexy and contorting bodies. As the poison took hold, many found themselves gasping for air as their heart rates skyrocketed, a jittery rush of adrenaline followed by an overwhelming surge of horror. Unbidden, a deep bestial rage seized them, their cries of alarm and fear fast becoming horrible, livid bellows of hate and fury.</i></p><p><i>         Those surrounding them began to shriek in terror as the now savage animals teemed forth and sunk their teeth, claws, and horns into those around them. In succession, the rest of the balloons burst, dousing mammals by the tens of thousands. Swinton\u2019s entourage formed a protective circle around her as screaming savages swarmed out of the bleachers and onto the field, their paws tearing up the sod. She sniffed disinterestedly as she ambled towards the exit.</i></p><p><i>         \u201cMa\u2019am!\u201d Stevens bellowed, his sidearm drawn. \u201cGet out of here, we\u2019ll hold them off!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cYes,\u201d Swinton chuckled airily, drawing an airgun from her purse. \u201cYou will.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Six the weapon hissed and her six guards lurched forward, clutching their necks. Swinton hurried towards the exit and pulled the door shut behind her.</i> \u201cA bit of a gamble, but I\u2019m willing to bet that if a savage tiger sees a bunch of enraged animals bearing down on him, he\u2019s not going to notice the pig behind him. Those six ought to keep that lot off the door out of sheer territoriality, and more effectively, too.\u201d</p><p><i>         A deafening roar rumbled through the door, sounds of carnage and battle raged from the other side. </i>\u201cSee? Come on, then. We\u2019ve got a chopper to get to.\u201d</p><p><i>         By the time she reached the helipad, the pilot was already halfway through the take-off sequence; the deafening whir of the copter blades as they whirled through the air only served to backdrop the undulating feral roars permeating the Oasis. Swinton rushed over to the door and leapt in, pulling on her flight helmet. \u201cParker! You coward, you were going to leave without me!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The pilot snapped around and looked at her, his eyes wide. \u201cMayor Swinton! What the hell is going on out there?! There was this group of animals that came nowhere! The guards you left here, they\u2026\u201d he swallowed thickly, as though the memory alone nauseated him. \u201cI managed to scare them off by turning on the chopper, I wasn\u2019t going to leave without you, I promise!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cShut up and take off!\u201d Swinton bellowed, buckling herself in.</i></p><p><i>         The helicopter lurched into the air as the engine thundered anew. The small, nimble craft gimbaled through the sky over the stadium, Swinton looked out at her handiwork; writhing throngs of animals poured out of the stadium and into the surrounding city, attacking all they saw. \u201cHm. That should keep Wilde busy for a few hours while I procure my bugout kit. What\u2019s that? Oh, I always knew it would come to this, one way or another, so I have a few articles that have all I need to start fresh in another city; a few million dollars, a fake passport, the names and numbers of the best forgers and plastic surgeons, the whole nine. I just have to get to my penthouse first.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The helicopter circled and began its descent above a lavish, hillside mansion. It settled on the rooftop helipad, before the chopper had even settled, Swinton had hopped out and was scampering across the flat plateau and towards the door. She clambered down the stairs and hurried into her spacious, tastefully appointed living room. She turned on the TV and selected the news channel. Already reports of the deluge of savages was pouring in, with footage of panicked crowds and roving packs of Gerald dragging down and mauling those unable to escape. Swinton heaved a sigh of relief, Marshal had managed to cook up a batch strong enough to overcome any and all sense of self-preservation, the city was now infested with nearly a hundred thousand rabid beasts. The odds of them being able to spare enough cops to take her in was just about nil. </i></p><p><i>         Just as well, she had made quite the speech and put on bit of a show back there. \u201cWhat can I say, I have a flair for the dramatic.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         She strode into her palatial room, the red satin bedsheets shone dimly in the soft light emanating from her chandelier. Swinton sighed and looked around at her possessions, off the top of her head she estimated that between the furniture and jewelry that there was something on the order of a million dollars in that room alone. She relented; it was only money, after all.</i></p><p><i>         \u201cI don\u2019t need much,\u201d she said, sighing. \u201cNever have. I simply like to have the best. I suppose that indulgence is what led to all this\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>         A low, sighing hiss from behind drew her attention to the door, she spun around to see a large, serpentine form slither into view. \u201cMy, but you\u2019ve made a mess out there, hmmm?\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Swinton loosed a shuddering breath, her heart thundering in her chest. \u201cEunectes! What are you doing here?\u201d</i></p><p><i>         The snake\u2019s massive head lifted up off the floor, her body slithered onward slowly in a seemingly endless coil. \u201cThose people at the stadium, they were no threat to you. They were not your enemies or rivals, yet you poisoned them, set them to kill their neighbors, your citizens, your fellow mammals.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cI never took you for the sentimental type, Your Excellency,\u201d Swinton sneered as she opened her closet and pulled out a suitcase filled with bank bonds.</i></p><p><i>         \u201cYour actions confuse me, is all,\u201d Eunectes said, her front quarter rearing up off the ground, her head brushing the 8-foot ceiling. \u201cIn Herpetopia, a failure such as yours is met with death, and those responsible are obliged to either accept their failure or find the weak link in the operation and dispose of it.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Swinton snorted hauled the suitcase across the room towards the door. \u201cI guess your fancy snekway doesn\u2019t have a GPS, otherwise you\u2019d have realized that we\u2019re not in your horrid country! Now, the way I see it, you need me to get away!\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cDo I, now?\u201d the giant snake rumbled. \u201cOh, by all means, elaborate.\u201d</i></p><p><i>         \u201cIf I go down, you go down! I\u2019ll squeal, to the cops, to Interpol, to anyone who will listen! You will be complicit in this clusterfuck, and even if you have diplomatic immunity, I don\u2019t imagine relations between our nations will continue long afterwards! Ties will break down and you\u2019ll be responsible, in the eyes of your peers and your Empress! How long do you think you\u2019ll last with that hanging over your head?\u201d Swinton spun around to glare at her uninvited guest, only to almost walk into Eunectes\u2019 reared up body. Swinton looked up, and up, and up until, finally, she met the eyes of the snake towering four feet over her head. \u201cW-what are you doing?\u201d</i></p><p><i>         Eunectes\u2019 mouth split into a decidedly unfriendly grin, her tail slowly coiling around Swinton\u2019s ankle. \u201cJust tying up a loose end.\u201d </i></p><p><i>         Eunectes slithered out and onto the impeccably groomed lawn, her long, somewhat bulbous body gliding over the grass with an eerie, fluid elegance.

Well, I suppose Marshal&rsquo;s botanical pursuits are about to pay off, hmm? If I can&rsquo;t make the people love me, I can make them hate everyone else a whole lot more.&rdquo;</p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swinton set her hands down on the podium, sipping from a glass of mineral water laid out for her. She cleared her throat and spoke into the mic. &ldquo;Assembled citizens of Zootopia, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for allowing me to address this most esteemed event in light of more recent controversy.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crowd bellowed, the teeming mass in the bleachers began to wave signs and effigies of her, some of which had already burst into flame. Swinton gave no indication that the display had affected her and continued. &ldquo;I will make no attempt to deny the veracity of the recording, nor will I comment on the charges brought against me, I would simply like to reiterate: thank you for permitting me to address you, all of you, the tens of thousands of you who attended this event, thank you. You&hellip;idiots.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The crowd&rsquo;s angry buzz died down, if she squinted, she could see them turning to one another, questioning if they had heard correctly.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swinton chuckled, smiling winsomely. &ldquo;You heard me. Look at you, all of you, you despise me and yet you came out to jeer. You don&rsquo;t know how happy I am that your spiteful, petty urges got the better of you and brought you here, to me, so that I can tell you this: the only thing I regret is the fact that I had to peddle and pander to you imbeciles to get into power. Getting elected is the worst part of politics by far, if only because it means I have to pretend that you things are my equals, to give speeches not one of you creatures comprehends, much less appreciates! Democracy is a vanity project for idiots, to make even dregs such as yourselves feel that your existence is validated. Well, how does it feel, Zootopia? You put me up here, you cast the ballots, and in record numbers! How does it feel, knowing that you voted for monster like me? That I, for years on end, had each and every one of your petty, puerile opinions wrapped around my finger?&rdquo; The crowd was silent, shocked, Swinton continued. &ldquo;Nothing to say? That&rsquo;s fine. You don&rsquo;t need to say anything. All you need to do is sit there and stew in the knowledge that I&rsquo;m going to get away and that you&rsquo;re going to help me. I played you, Zootopia; I played you like a harp from hell. But now the song&rsquo;s over, so enjoy the encore.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Swinton raised her arms and grinned, all around the stadium dozens upon dozens of enormous confetti balloons began to inflate. The crowd murmured in alarm as they rose into the air, position themselves directly above the bleachers, several hundred feet over their heads. The balloons tumbled and gyred as they rose, their distended forms filled with millions upon millions of tiny blue pellets mixed in with the ribbons of string and tabs of paper.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A cry went out and the attendees flinched simultaneously as one of the balloons burst with a thunderous crack, disappearing in a cloud swirling red, white, and blue. Amidst the fluttering debris, millions of murderous pellets the size of BBs streaked out of the sky onto the people below, peppering them with splotches of cerulean jelly. Those affected blinked in confusion for a moment, dabbing the substances dotting their bodies with their fingers. More than a few sniffed the goo, swirling it around between their fingers. Then, they began to twitch. A few spasms at first, but soon the bleachers were a sea of apoplexy and contorting bodies. As the poison took hold, many found themselves gasping for air as their heart rates skyrocketed, a jittery rush of adrenaline followed by an overwhelming surge of horror. Unbidden, a deep bestial rage seized them, their cries of alarm and fear fast becoming horrible, livid bellows of hate and fury.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those surrounding them began to shriek in terror as the now savage animals teemed forth and sunk their teeth, claws, and horns into those around them. In succession, the rest of the balloons burst, dousing mammals by the tens of thousands. Swinton&rsquo;s entourage formed a protective circle around her as screaming savages swarmed out of the bleachers and onto the field, their paws tearing up the sod. She sniffed disinterestedly as she ambled towards the exit.</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; Stevens bellowed, his sidearm drawn. &ldquo;Get out of here, we&rsquo;ll hold them off!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Swinton chuckled airily, drawing an airgun from her purse. &ldquo;You will.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Six the weapon hissed and her six guards lurched forward, clutching their necks. Swinton hurried towards the exit and pulled the door shut behind her.</i> &ldquo;A bit of a gamble, but I&rsquo;m willing to bet that if a savage tiger sees a bunch of enraged animals bearing down on him, he&rsquo;s not going to notice the pig behind him. Those six ought to keep that lot off the door out of sheer territoriality, and more effectively, too.&rdquo;</p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A deafening roar rumbled through the door, sounds of carnage and battle raged from the other side. </i>&ldquo;See? Come on, then. We&rsquo;ve got a chopper to get to.&rdquo;</p><p><i> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By the time she reached the helipad, the pilot was already halfway through the take-off sequence; the deafening whir of the copter blades as they whirled through the air only served to backdrop the undulating feral roars permeating the Oasis.

&lsquo;Eunectes&rsquo;, this stupendous serpent rules the lives of millions with an iron coil. Despite her relatively bloodless rise to power in a society that demands shows of strength, none have challenged her rule in all her 60 year tenure. Visiting Zootopian journalists suspect that her fabulous wealth and skill as a negotiator is responsible for this unprecedented feat, while local writers quietly note that many of her detractors have been known to mysteriously disappear.</i></p><p><i>A savvy, suspicious snake, Eunectes sees more than she lets on. Friends and enemies alike who underestimate this massive ophidian would do well to remember that anacondas are ambush predators; watching and waiting, patiently and without mercy, for the right moment to strike.\n\n</i></p><hr><p>One of the main characters of the Swinton side-fic! Had a good time experimenting with art styles on the beautiful and cold-blooded giant anaconda Eunectes. And her story continues in Pearls Before Swine chapter 3! There\u2019s more under the cut!</p><hr><p><i>Swinton\nsat at her custom-made mahogany desk, watching her computer screen\nintently. She tapped her fingers happily on the shiny, near-mirror\nfinish of the dense, hard wood inlaid with gold leaf; she loved\nwatching her various accounts swell with Reptilian revenue. Even\nthough the currency had to be laundered somewhat before it got to\nher, Herpetopian dinars raised a few eyebrows unless they were spread\nto the right pockets. Not that she needed to worry about any of that,\nshe had set up that whole kit and kaboodle years ago, and there was\nno way anyone would sniff it out. Not without her knowing, anyway.</i></p><p><i>\nThere\nwas a thump at the door, Swinton\u2019s eyebrow arched at the muffled\n\u201c\u2026Ow,\u201d that followed.</i></p><p>\n\u201cA\ntwenty pound rabbit vs a two-hundred pound ironwood door.\u201d<i>\nShe smirked . \u201cIt\u2019s open, come in.\u201d</i></p>\x3c!-- more --\x3e<p><i>\nThe\nheavy, bull-oak wood door creaked open and Officer Hopps limped in,\nlooking somewhat put off. She rallied quickly, though, and marched\nover to Swinton. \u201cAlright, Swinton, I\u2019m on to you! The\npi\u2013the gig is up! I know what you\u2019re up to!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\nSwinton\nsteepled her fingers and donned a bemused expression. \u201cOh?

Is it the drug ring, the fur farm, or the money\nlaundering?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\nJuly\u2019s\njaw dropped, her nonplussed expression nearly drove Swinton to\nhysterics. \u201cUhh\u2026th-the money laundering.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cPsssh!\u201d\nSwinton scoffed, waving the bunny off dismissively. \u201cPlease! The\nfur farm is <b>much </b>worse\nthan that. No kidding, there are cells, drugs, doctors, all sorts of\nstuff.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nJuly said, regaining her footing. \u201cAre you insane?! I\u2019m a cop!\nYou can\u2019t just tell me this stuff! I can arrest you!\u201d</i></p><p>\n\u201cThis\nis even easier than I thought. She\u2019s so desperate to make a name\nfor herself she can\u2019t see when she\u2019s being led!\u201d\n<i>Swinton rolled her eyes and got to her feet, gratified when the bunny\ndrew back as she walked forward. \u201cNo\u2026you\u2019re a meter-maid,\nyou write tickets and get yelled at by entitled wage-slaves down on\nskid-row, that\u2019s your job and I must say you excel at\nit. I admit, following the money from one of my associate\u2019s\noutstanding parking tickets was clever, but running up here and\nconfronting me about it?

Not hard to arrange for some\npoor inner-city youth to bump into a meter-maid, is it? Incidentally,\nthere are some excellent pick-pockets down there.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\nJuly\nfumed and grit her teeth. \u201cI still have my findings.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d\nSwinton said, casually. \u201cBut that\u2019s not even enough to get a\nrejection letter from the four or five judges that I don\u2019t own.\nYou\u2019ll need something a little more\u2026concrete. Besides,when you\ntry to run with this and when it\nfails, expect major cutbacks in ZPD funding, not to mention strict\nbackground checks on all academy trainees. Officers will be lost and\nnot replaced, wages will plummet, crime will run rampant and I\u2019ll\nhave all the reason I need to see that tod Wilde out on his bushy\ntail without pension! Maybe I\u2019ll see him down at the shelter? Hell,\nmaybe all you cops\u2019ll wind up there and have a little reunion!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\nJuly\nsighed and deflated. \u201cAnd if I keep quiet about it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cIf\nyou do,\u201d Swinton said, smirking. \u201cThen nothing changes apart from\nmy opinion on bunnies and their intelligence. Are we clear, Hopps?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cLike\nLalique,\u201d Hopps grumbled, nodding at the glass in Swinton\u2019s hand.</i></p><p><i>\n\u201cAh!\nA rabbit with taste! Stop the presses!\u201d Swinton laughed flintily\nand downed her glass, turning her back on the bunny. \u201cYou may\nleave, now.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\nThe\nbunny sighed and shuffled out, defeated. Swinton waited for the door\nto shut before hurrying around her desk and picking up her cellphone.</i>\n\u201cShe\u2019s good, much better than I thought, playing the beaten\nand broken card like that. But make no mistake; you have to wake up\npretty early to pull one over on me. If she\u2019s anything like her\naunt, all the clues I dropped in that little back-and-forth should\nhave put her on the right track. Better call Porosus, let him know\nshe\u2019s coming. Heh! She\u2019ll probably scout the place out before she\ncalls in back-up, the timid little greenhorn. I can just imagine her\nsurprise when she comes face to face with that old dinosaur! She\u2019ll\nbarely get stuck in his teeth!\u201d</p><p><i>\nSwinton\ntexted Marshal, smirking mirthlessly. \u2018Heads up, Marshal, you\u2019ve\ngot a cop inbound.\u2019</i></p><p><i>\n\u2018WHAT\u2019</i></p><p><i>\n\u2018Calm\ndown.

Reptilian Emissary Arrested&rsquo;. The\nfarm was lost, Marshal, Porosus, and everyone else was in custody and\nthe stock had been freed. Swinton gritted her teeth, there was no\nchance of this leading back to her, no one would talk and nothing the\nstock had to say would hold up under the scrutiny of a competent\ndefense attorney. But it still stung. It wasn&rsquo;t just money she had\nlost, and she had lost a lot, but her connections in Herpetopia were\nnow an utter shambles; Eunectes would distance herself from this\nfiasco, likely never to return, and with her Swinton&rsquo;s hoof in the\ndoor with an ancient and extremely wealthy market. More that, more\nthan the money and the connections, Swinton had\nlost. For the first time, things had not gone according to plan, all\nbecause of a tiny, impulsive rabbit.</i></p><p><i>\nNo.\nIt wasn&rsquo;t the money at all.</i></p><p><i>\nSwinton\nreclined in her chair, staring the Lalique crystal in her hand. She\npoured the ice cubes out and onto the carpet and hurled the\nbeautifully crafted glass at the opposite wall. It shattered\nspectacularly, the shards glittered incandescently in the soft light\nof the 60-watt bulbs suspended above. The sound was hard, sharp, and\ntinkling, clear as a bell and piercing.</i></p><p>\n\u201cSix\nhundred dollars,\u201d\n<i>Swinton hissed,</i> \u201cI\ndon&rsquo;t miss it.

All this, everything, is\nonly money. I am long, <b>long</b>,\npast the point of caring about money.\u201d</p><p><i>\nSwinton\nheld up a bottle of scotch.</i> \u201cHighland Scotch, aged 25 years and\nfinished in a port barrel. Four hundred dollars a bottle&hellip;\u201d<i>\nThe amber liquid pooled on the gouged mahogany as she poured it out.\n</i>\u201cMight as well be a plastic bottle of bargain bin ripple for all\nI care\u2026the things my father would have done for this expensive\nswill, and here I am, pouring it out.

If he\nweren\u2019t already dead, that is\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>\nSwinton\nset the empty bottle down, glaring at her reflection in the puddle.\n</i>\u201cMy father\u2026a drinker and a lout. Coasting through life on\nwelfare cheques, drinking through half of mother&rsquo;s pay and gambling\naway the rest. Two brothers, a sister, my mother, me, he kept us all\nunder his hoof. To this day I don&rsquo;t know how he did it, he was a man\nof few talents, fewer scruples, and truly breathtaking ignorance; yet\nhe swaggered about our hovel like some gilded king.\u201d</p><p><i>\nSwinton\nturned around and gazed out the window, overseeing the sprawl of\nZootopia. </i>\u201cIf he taught me anything, it was this: money is a\nmeans to an end, and that end is control. Withholding our money, he\ncontrolled us, he dominated us, and through us he got all he ever\nneeded out of life.\u201d<i> Swinton grinned, toothily. </i>\u201cHe also\ntaught me that one need only drop a little bait for a boar to charge\nheadlong into a trap. Our hovel was spartan, with steep, sharp\nstairs&hellip;The fall didn&rsquo;t kill him, not right away. I remember how he\nlooked up at me as I knelt down next to him, his eyes wide and wild\nand enraged. His airway was twisted shut, he couldn&rsquo;t speak, but\nnot for lack of trying. He gurgled and sputtered, the closest he ever\ncame to giving his final words was a mewling &rsquo;&hellip;please&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p><p>\nI\nsat and watched for thirty minutes, and when I was <i>sure </i>he was dead I\nran into the night, shouting and crying as loud as I could. There was\na suitable uproar, a funeral, the whole nine. We were the talk of the\nneighborhood for weeks. It felt good, like a reward, almost. It was\nthen that I learned how easy it was to sway the public, how trivial a\ntask to get a group of people to agree on an absolute farce. To this\nday people still speak of Oscar Swinton fondly. It was then that I\nknew my calling. The media, public opinion, politics. It was my kind\nof game and I play <i>dirty</i>.\u201d</p><p><i>\nSwinton\nexamined the mess she had made, her lip curling in disgust.</i> \u201cSpeaking\nof dirty.\u201d<i> She depressed a labeled button on her intercom.\n\u201cLydia.

If you hire local, you get local; and when the work\u2019s on skid row, well\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>She set the glass down on the mini-bar; the pillowy soft suspension of the Mercedes-Maybach Pullman ensured that there would be no spillage.</i> \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering who I\u2019m talking to. And now, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re probably wondering \u2018where are we? Where are we going?\u2019 That\u2019s not my problem. You just wait and see. Trust me, you\u2019re going to love this.\u201d</p><p><i>The Pullman pulled up to a large, spacious-looking building surrounded by slum apartments and a few greasy spoons. Waiting on the steps of the building was a nervous-looking marmot; he was wearing a hardhat and high-visibility vest, just like he had been instructed to.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him, his name is Marshal\u2026something, I didn\u2019t bother to remember,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stepped out of the Pullman. </i>\u201cHe\u2019s quite good at what he does, and cheap, too. Though, I suppose one hundred thousand a year, tax-free, is better than whatever crumbs he was getting before at the mental institution. The clientele are similar, too.\u201d</p><p><i>She looked up at Marshal as she walked up the steps. \u201cThis had better be good, Marshal! I can only write off so many trips down here as inspections before the wrong eyebrows start to rise!\u201d She stomped up to the cowering marmot, towering over him. \u201cNow, what is so bloody important that you can\u2019t talk about it over the phone?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour business partner,\u201d he mumbled, avoiding her gaze. \u201cS-she showed up about twenty minutes ago at the\u2026the farm. She wouldn\u2019t leave when I asked her to, said I had to get you to talk to her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh,\u201d Swinton stepped back.</i> \u201cMarshal\u2019s a good boy. He has a good head for this business, very discreet.\u201d <i>She leaned back in, a winning smile on her face. \u201cYou did the right thing, Marshal, that\u2019s definitely not a name I want uttered on my phone, where anyone could be listening. Expect a raise at the end of the month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d Marshal stammered, bowing his head and handing her a hardhat. \u201cThis way, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She walked through the huge main hall of the building, long tables stretched from one end to the other in massive lines, with seating and accommodations for mammals of all sizes. The heavy, chemical smell of fresh paint hung in the air, mingling with the scent of sawdust and drywall. It was the newest building this side of Pack Street by at least twenty years.</i> \u201cA homeless shelter, in case you were wondering. <i>The </i>homeless shelter, in fact. The largest, most accommodating, most well funded shelter in the city! It has it\u2019s own trust fund and everything. When it opens next week, it\u2019ll be able to hold nearly five hundred medium-sized mammals. The filth flows in and flows back out, when there\u2019s that many of them, who\u2019s going to miss one or two here and there? Confused? Follow me, then. Don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d</p><p><i>Swinton and Marshal entered the kitchen area and walked into the massive refrigerator. Marshal reached down and pried open the drain grate; he reached down into the hole and pulled the release cable within. There was a clunk and the floor rose up before falling away, the tiles parting to form stairs. They descended the stairs and came upon a set of rails that stretched off into a dark, sporadically lit tunnel. Marshal hopped onto a nearby tram and opened the door for her, he powered up the little platform as she seated herself.</i></p><p>\u201cNot the most stylish way to travel,\u201d <i>Swinton muttered, before smiling,</i> \u201cBut then, it wasn\u2019t meant for me, was it? In fact, most of the people who\u2019ll see this tunnel will have only a bike seat or vinyl covered transit bench for comparison. Still confused? Good. The surprise will make it better.\u201d</p><p><i>The tram squeaked to a stop at the foot of another set of concrete stairs. Swinton and Marshal ascended them and stepped into a hallway lined with cells, the plexiglass doors revealed rooms with simple toiletries and a sturdy-if- austere bunk. Many of the cells were empty, but some were not. Marshal tried his best to keep his eyes ahead, not looking at the vacant, forlorn eyes staring out at them as they walked by. Swinton had so such compunctions.</i></p><p>\u201cPart of being a responsible farmer is resource management,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stopped to examine the stock, a thin, hollow-cheeked snow leopard dressed in nothing but a white hospital gown; her pale green eyes gazed back as she cowered away. </i>\u201cLike this. A new acquisition, but one of interest. Our customers will pay top dollar for her coat, but as is she\u2019s not in the best of shape, too thin, too fragile. We\u2019ll need to fatten her up before we shave her. It\u2019s the only compassionate option, you see.\u201d <i>Swinton turned to Marshal. \u201cThis one! She\u2019s a little thin, isn\u2019t she? I was in here not two weeks ago and she looks like she hasn\u2019t gained a pound!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal nodded and stepped forward, not looking at the captive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am, but she won\u2019t eat; not a bite for days! We\u2019ll have to put her on an I.V. if this keeps up.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMarshal. He\u2019s got a good head, but a soft heart,\u201d <i>Swinton grunted, turning back to Marshal. \u201cAn I.V will only keep her alive. We need her to be healthy and fat! Put her under and make her eat through a tube!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Ma\u2019am\u2013!\u201d Marshal began.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut what?!\u201d Swinton hissed. \u201cShe\u2019s a snow leopard! Dense, rich, thick fur in a naturally beautiful pattern! Do you have any idea how much the Reptilians will pay for a square foot of her pelt? Get her healthy again, then hook her on \u2018nip or something and withhold it until she eats. It\u2019s that simple!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal blinked, his expression shocked, before he looked down at his feet and nodded. \u201cY-yes, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll get some nurses on it ASAP.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Swinton said, flicking her blonde hair out of her eyes as she resumed back down the hall. </i>\u201cSee what I have to work with here? Honestly, it\u2019s like I have to do everything myself!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>Swinton stepped out into the parking lot outside the farm building, a large, abandoned-looking warehouse with boarded over windows and gang-tags scrawling the walls. She was assured somewhat by the high walls surrounding the lot that they would not be spied on. Swinton looked around, unconsciously sniffing the air. \u201cI\u2019m here now. You can come out of hiding.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a rustling sound followed by a dull electric keening, Swinton looked over to see a ripple and crease in the air, the image shimmered and distorted before retracting upwards, eventually revealing part of a large grey parasol that stretched to the ground. The parasol lifted up, beneath it a polished platinum-white metallic platform partially encased in an articulated, gold-plated dome. The platform was some five feet across and rolled forward on a single black sphere 1/3<sup>rd</sup> embedded in the bottom. The parasol folded and retreated further on its mechanical arm, finally disappearing into an ornately designed terrace that encircled the dome, save for an opening at the front. The dome clicked and opened partially, revealing a dark recess within. From the shadowy depths shone two glittering marbles atop a mass of dimly lustrous scales. A foot-long purplish tongue flicked out and tasted the air, followed by her massive, triangular head. Hidden within the rolling machine were the endless, overlapping coils of an exceptionally huge and imposing green anaconda, the visiting envoy from Herpetopia. Her scales we a dim and lustrous earthy green offset by the polished gold metal plates and technicolor feathers of her articulated headdress; truly, a regal creature.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbassador Eunectes,\u201d Swinton said, bowing shallowly to convey respect but not submission. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected visit?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo special reason, Mayor Swinton,\u201d the enormous snake said, her voice was low and almost soothing in its gelid timbre, like a slow trickle of ice water. \u201cI merely wished to inspect the workings of our mutual business arrangement. Naturally, I must gauge the potential output of such a facility.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Swinton said, smirking as she looked aside.</i> \u201cRepulsive creatures, truly, but they make good business partners. See, walk a mammal through the farm and they\u2019re liable to fly into some kind of moral outrage. But a Reptile? Their first question would be \u2018do you charge by the square foot, or the square meter?\u2019 followed quickly by \u2018what is your projected annual output?\u2019 From there it\u2019s all about negotiation.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d Marshal said from behind. \u201cI tried to explain to her why she couldn\u2019t be here, but she refused to leave.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut, of course,\u201d Swinton said, not breaking eye-contact with Eunectes. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to a Mammal, here, Marshal. You probably told her to leave and then tried to explain why. It doesn\u2019t matter how good of a reason you gave, you, as an inferior, issued orders to her, a highly venerated and respected member of the aristocracy; she was practically obliged to disregard your request.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d Marshal looked at his feet, confused.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour groundskeeper stank of earth and moldy onions,\u201d Eunectes murmured, locking a glassy, predatory glare on the terrified marmot. \u201cInteresting that you would elect a farmhand to oversee this operation.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMarshal has an advanced skill set outside of his burgeoning talents in horticulture,\u201d Swinton countered, her tone carrying just the right amount of veiled conceit as to excite the Reptile\u2019s curiosity. \u201cHe\u2019s presently working on a\u2026 side-project. Cultivating exotic flora and the like.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM-ma\u2019am!\u201d Marshal exclaimed, fidgeting nervously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh!\u201d Swinton interrupted. \u201cGo inside and make sure our finest stock is on display. Prepare the samples and some refreshments for our guests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGuests?\u201d Marshal muttered. \u201cBut she\u2019s the only\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i>Two massive saltwater crocodiles stepped forward, their cloaks flickering as they attempted to emulate the change in surroundings; with a deliberate flair they pushed the chameleo-lattice back over their shoulders. They were intimidating specimens; reared up on their hind legs they must have been twelve feet tall if not a foot, and probably weighed upwards of two thousand pounds. Her guards stepped forward and uttered deep thunderous bellows; Marshal squeaked and scurried towards the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus!\u201d Swinton exclaimed, smiling toothily as she approached the larger of the two. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown since I last saw you. You\u2019ve been eating well, I trust?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy former commander did not swim strongly enough,\u201d Porosus rumbled. \u201cThe current of the capitol pushed him into my jaws. My inheritance by him has seen me well fed this past year.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t guess it from looking at them, but Reptilians pride themselves on florid metaphors and wordplay in common conversation. Though brutal as a race, they see it as a sign of civility to cultivate an advanced vocabulary and wit.\u201d <i>Swinton chuckled and nodded respectfully. </i>\u201cMake no mistake, though, even metaphors can be deadly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI assume you have some questions, then, Ambassador?\u201d Swinton said, gesturing for them to follow.</i></p><p><i>They did, Swinton held open the door and took care to make her back was to them, as a sign of confidence in their mutual agreement.</i> \u201cAh, Reptilians. Older, wiser, much more advanced. If they were Mammals, they would have conquered the world by now! Luckily, their basic psychology prevents them from trusting one another long enough to do anything but hold onto what they have. They\u2019re intelligent, ruthless, self-absorbed, and intrinsically untrustworthy. Utterly predictable. The perfect business partners.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cAnd through here, you\u2019ll notice a few samples of our stock,\u201d Swinton said, gesturing at the five or so Mammals standing at attention in their cells. \u201cAs you can plainly see, they are healthy, well-fed, and meticulously groomed. Their fur should be ready for harvest within a week. After their fur is shaved and affixed to a sheet, the stock is sent to the care wing to recuperate while another lot is prepped for harvest.\u201d Swinton turned to her company. \u201cAt present, we can maintain an output of 150 square feet per month, and the best part is, it\u2019s renewable!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIndeed, and the slow-growing crop yields the highest demand,\u201d Eunectes said, extending her thick body to examine one of the captives, a cowering coypu. \u201cFrom whence do these wretches come? I understand Mammals can find room in their hearts for many, who are these that their absence goes unheeded?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVagrants and indigents, mostly,\u201d Swinton said, with a snort. \u201cThe homeless, the insane, the lazy. At least here they are of use to someone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Eunectes cooed. \u201cSuch flaws in character and blood are not suffered in Herpetopia. Citizens flaunting such traits are recycled, as is their right as weaklings. That you have divined such a use for the detritus of your race speaks volumes of your business acumen. We will renew our contract.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the bait,\u201d <i>Swinton grumbled. </i>\u201cHere comes the switch. If I don\u2019t impress now, they\u2019ll be a lot less coy next time around.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHowever,\u201d Eunectes hissed.</i></p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThere is a concern regarding output,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhile 150 square feet per month is certainly ideal for maintaining demand, we must be able to accommodate at least ten times that amount for\u2026extraordinary circumstances. There are hisses of the Empress taking an interest in Mammalian products; therefore we must be prepared to fulfill any outrageous demand. Can you be relied upon to oblige her potential appetites?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Swinton smirked and flipped a switch on the wall, the lights in the long hallway snapped on in sequence, revealing row after row of cells. \u201cThere are five more wings like this one in the building. At present, we are operating at 1% capacity. With a nearby shelter providing quick, easy access to resources, each one of those cells should be full by the end of the year. I hope your Empress likes fur.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eunectes hissed appreciatively, her beady, lidless eyes glittered in the florescent lights.</i></p><p><i>Back out in the parking lot, Swinton was accompanying Eunectes and her smaller guard out of the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus will stay and oversee the project in my stead,\u201d Eunectes said. \u201cI hope that is not too great an imposition.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Swinton said, shaking her head. \u201cHe will bring a certain respectability and elegance to the place, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmm,\u201d Eunectes said, nodding appreciatively. \u201cI must say, Mayor Swinton, it is rare to meet a Mammal with so many admirable traits as yourself. I am pleased to resume business with you.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAdmirable traits,\u201d<i> Swinton scoffed.</i> \u201cNo doubt she\u2019s referring to my casual disregard for the stock in there. Not many people know this, but willful cruelty is a distinctly Mammalian trait. Reptiles, on the other hand, simply have no regard for the wellbeing of others; they have no need to inflict pointless cruelty. Typically, they see our social interactions as quaint at best, and as obstructions of business at worst. My disregard for the stock as people but my good treatment of them as product has no doubt left a good impression.\u201d <i>She turned and smiled, laughing airily. \u201cOh, why thank you, Ambassador!

Can you imagine the gall? He\u2019d still be working at a mad house if it weren\u2019t for me!\u201d <i>she looked out the window, watching the slum houses rush by in a blur; the tinted windows were up and was her lip as it curled into a sneer. </i>\u201cHonestly, what could I expect from such stock? If you hire local, you get local; and when the work\u2019s on skid row, well\u2026\u201d</p><p><i>She set the glass down on the mini-bar; the pillowy soft suspension of the Mercedes-Maybach Pullman ensured that there would be no spillage.</i> \u201cI suppose you\u2019re wondering who I\u2019m talking to. And now, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re probably wondering \u2018where are we? Where are we going?\u2019 That\u2019s not my problem. You just wait and see. Trust me, you\u2019re going to love this.\u201d</p><p><i>The Pullman pulled up to a large, spacious-looking building surrounded by slum apartments and a few greasy spoons. Waiting on the steps of the building was a nervous-looking marmot; he was wearing a hardhat and high-visibility vest, just like he had been instructed to.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him, his name is Marshal\u2026something, I didn\u2019t bother to remember,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stepped out of the Pullman. </i>\u201cHe\u2019s quite good at what he does, and cheap, too. Though, I suppose one hundred thousand a year, tax-free, is better than whatever crumbs he was getting before at the mental institution. The clientele are similar, too.\u201d</p><p><i>She looked up at Marshal as she walked up the steps. \u201cThis had better be good, Marshal! I can only write off so many trips down here as inspections before the wrong eyebrows start to rise!\u201d She stomped up to the cowering marmot, towering over him. \u201cNow, what is so bloody important that you can\u2019t talk about it over the phone?!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour business partner,\u201d he mumbled, avoiding her gaze. \u201cS-she showed up about twenty minutes ago at the\u2026the farm. She wouldn\u2019t leave when I asked her to, said I had to get you to talk to her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh,\u201d Swinton stepped back.</i> \u201cMarshal\u2019s a good boy. He has a good head for this business, very discreet.\u201d <i>She leaned back in, a winning smile on her face. \u201cYou did the right thing, Marshal, that\u2019s definitely not a name I want uttered on my phone, where anyone could be listening. Expect a raise at the end of the month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d Marshal stammered, bowing his head and handing her a hardhat. \u201cThis way, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She walked through the huge main hall of the building, long tables stretched from one end to the other in massive lines, with seating and accommodations for mammals of all sizes. The heavy, chemical smell of fresh paint hung in the air, mingling with the scent of sawdust and drywall. It was the newest building this side of Pack Street by at least twenty years.</i> \u201cA homeless shelter, in case you were wondering. <i>The </i>homeless shelter, in fact. The largest, most accommodating, most well funded shelter in the city! It has it\u2019s own trust fund and everything. When it opens next week, it\u2019ll be able to hold nearly five hundred medium-sized mammals. The filth flows in and flows back out, when there\u2019s that many of them, who\u2019s going to miss one or two here and there? Confused? Follow me, then. Don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d</p><p><i>Swinton and Marshal entered the kitchen area and walked into the massive refrigerator. Marshal reached down and pried open the drain grate; he reached down into the hole and pulled the release cable within. There was a clunk and the floor rose up before falling away, the tiles parting to form stairs. They descended the stairs and came upon a set of rails that stretched off into a dark, sporadically lit tunnel. Marshal hopped onto a nearby tram and opened the door for her, he powered up the little platform as she seated herself.</i></p><p>\u201cNot the most stylish way to travel,\u201d <i>Swinton muttered, before smiling,</i> \u201cBut then, it wasn\u2019t meant for me, was it? In fact, most of the people who\u2019ll see this tunnel will have only a bike seat or vinyl covered transit bench for comparison. Still confused? Good. The surprise will make it better.\u201d</p><p><i>The tram squeaked to a stop at the foot of another set of concrete stairs. Swinton and Marshal ascended them and stepped into a hallway lined with cells, the plexiglass doors revealed rooms with simple toiletries and a sturdy-if- austere bunk. Many of the cells were empty, but some were not. Marshal tried his best to keep his eyes ahead, not looking at the vacant, forlorn eyes staring out at them as they walked by. Swinton had so such compunctions.</i></p><p>\u201cPart of being a responsible farmer is resource management,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stopped to examine the stock, a thin, hollow-cheeked snow leopard dressed in nothing but a white hospital gown; her pale green eyes gazed back as she cowered away. </i>\u201cLike this. A new acquisition, but one of interest. Our customers will pay top dollar for her coat, but as is she\u2019s not in the best of shape, too thin, too fragile. We\u2019ll need to fatten her up before we shave her. It\u2019s the only compassionate option, you see.\u201d <i>Swinton turned to Marshal. \u201cThis one! She\u2019s a little thin, isn\u2019t she? I was in here not two weeks ago and she looks like she hasn\u2019t gained a pound!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal nodded and stepped forward, not looking at the captive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am, but she won\u2019t eat; not a bite for days! We\u2019ll have to put her on an I.V. if this keeps up.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMarshal. He\u2019s got a good head, but a soft heart,\u201d <i>Swinton grunted, turning back to Marshal. \u201cAn I.V will only keep her alive. We need her to be healthy and fat! Put her under and make her eat through a tube!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Ma\u2019am\u2013!\u201d Marshal began.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut what?!\u201d Swinton hissed. \u201cShe\u2019s a snow leopard! Dense, rich, thick fur in a naturally beautiful pattern! Do you have any idea how much the Reptilians will pay for a square foot of her pelt? Get her healthy again, then hook her on \u2018nip or something and withhold it until she eats. It\u2019s that simple!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal blinked, his expression shocked, before he looked down at his feet and nodded. \u201cY-yes, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll get some nurses on it ASAP.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Swinton said, flicking her blonde hair out of her eyes as she resumed back down the hall. </i>\u201cSee what I have to work with here? Honestly, it\u2019s like I have to do everything myself!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>Swinton stepped out into the parking lot outside the farm building, a large, abandoned-looking warehouse with boarded over windows and gang-tags scrawling the walls. She was assured somewhat by the high walls surrounding the lot that they would not be spied on. Swinton looked around, unconsciously sniffing the air. \u201cI\u2019m here now. You can come out of hiding.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a rustling sound followed by a dull electric keening, Swinton looked over to see a ripple and crease in the air, the image shimmered and distorted before retracting upwards, eventually revealing part of a large grey parasol that stretched to the ground. The parasol lifted up, beneath it a polished platinum-white metallic platform partially encased in an articulated, gold-plated dome. The platform was some five feet across and rolled forward on a single black sphere 1/3<sup>rd</sup> embedded in the bottom. The parasol folded and retreated further on its mechanical arm, finally disappearing into an ornately designed terrace that encircled the dome, save for an opening at the front. The dome clicked and opened partially, revealing a dark recess within. From the shadowy depths shone two glittering marbles atop a mass of dimly lustrous scales. A foot-long purplish tongue flicked out and tasted the air, followed by her massive, triangular head. Hidden within the rolling machine were the endless, overlapping coils of an exceptionally huge and imposing green anaconda, the visiting envoy from Herpetopia. Her scales we a dim and lustrous earthy green offset by the polished gold metal plates and technicolor feathers of her articulated headdress; truly, a regal creature.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbassador Eunectes,\u201d Swinton said, bowing shallowly to convey respect but not submission. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected visit?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo special reason, Mayor Swinton,\u201d the enormous snake said, her voice was low and almost soothing in its gelid timbre, like a slow trickle of ice water. \u201cI merely wished to inspect the workings of our mutual business arrangement. Naturally, I must gauge the potential output of such a facility.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Swinton said, smirking as she looked aside.</i> \u201cRepulsive creatures, truly, but they make good business partners. See, walk a mammal through the farm and they\u2019re liable to fly into some kind of moral outrage. But a Reptile? Their first question would be \u2018do you charge by the square foot, or the square meter?\u2019 followed quickly by \u2018what is your projected annual output?\u2019 From there it\u2019s all about negotiation.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d Marshal said from behind. \u201cI tried to explain to her why she couldn\u2019t be here, but she refused to leave.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut, of course,\u201d Swinton said, not breaking eye-contact with Eunectes. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to a Mammal, here, Marshal. You probably told her to leave and then tried to explain why. It doesn\u2019t matter how good of a reason you gave, you, as an inferior, issued orders to her, a highly venerated and respected member of the aristocracy; she was practically obliged to disregard your request.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d Marshal looked at his feet, confused.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour groundskeeper stank of earth and moldy onions,\u201d Eunectes murmured, locking a glassy, predatory glare on the terrified marmot. \u201cInteresting that you would elect a farmhand to oversee this operation.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMarshal has an advanced skill set outside of his burgeoning talents in horticulture,\u201d Swinton countered, her tone carrying just the right amount of veiled conceit as to excite the Reptile\u2019s curiosity. \u201cHe\u2019s presently working on a\u2026 side-project. Cultivating exotic flora and the like.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM-ma\u2019am!\u201d Marshal exclaimed, fidgeting nervously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh!\u201d Swinton interrupted. \u201cGo inside and make sure our finest stock is on display. Prepare the samples and some refreshments for our guests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGuests?\u201d Marshal muttered. \u201cBut she\u2019s the only\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i>Two massive saltwater crocodiles stepped forward, their cloaks flickering as they attempted to emulate the change in surroundings; with a deliberate flair they pushed the chameleo-lattice back over their shoulders. They were intimidating specimens; reared up on their hind legs they must have been twelve feet tall if not a foot, and probably weighed upwards of two thousand pounds. Her guards stepped forward and uttered deep thunderous bellows; Marshal squeaked and scurried towards the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus!\u201d Swinton exclaimed, smiling toothily as she approached the larger of the two. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown since I last saw you. You\u2019ve been eating well, I trust?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy former commander did not swim strongly enough,\u201d Porosus rumbled. \u201cThe current of the capitol pushed him into my jaws. My inheritance by him has seen me well fed this past year.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t guess it from looking at them, but Reptilians pride themselves on florid metaphors and wordplay in common conversation. Though brutal as a race, they see it as a sign of civility to cultivate an advanced vocabulary and wit.\u201d <i>Swinton chuckled and nodded respectfully. </i>\u201cMake no mistake, though, even metaphors can be deadly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI assume you have some questions, then, Ambassador?\u201d Swinton said, gesturing for them to follow.</i></p><p><i>They did, Swinton held open the door and took care to make her back was to them, as a sign of confidence in their mutual agreement.</i> \u201cAh, Reptilians. Older, wiser, much more advanced. If they were Mammals, they would have conquered the world by now! Luckily, their basic psychology prevents them from trusting one another long enough to do anything but hold onto what they have. They\u2019re intelligent, ruthless, self-absorbed, and intrinsically untrustworthy. Utterly predictable. The perfect business partners.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cAnd through here, you\u2019ll notice a few samples of our stock,\u201d Swinton said, gesturing at the five or so Mammals standing at attention in their cells. \u201cAs you can plainly see, they are healthy, well-fed, and meticulously groomed. Their fur should be ready for harvest within a week. After their fur is shaved and affixed to a sheet, the stock is sent to the care wing to recuperate while another lot is prepped for harvest.\u201d Swinton turned to her company. \u201cAt present, we can maintain an output of 150 square feet per month, and the best part is, it\u2019s renewable!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIndeed, and the slow-growing crop yields the highest demand,\u201d Eunectes said, extending her thick body to examine one of the captives, a cowering coypu. \u201cFrom whence do these wretches come? I understand Mammals can find room in their hearts for many, who are these that their absence goes unheeded?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVagrants and indigents, mostly,\u201d Swinton said, with a snort. \u201cThe homeless, the insane, the lazy. At least here they are of use to someone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Eunectes cooed. \u201cSuch flaws in character and blood are not suffered in Herpetopia. Citizens flaunting such traits are recycled, as is their right as weaklings. That you have divined such a use for the detritus of your race speaks volumes of your business acumen. We will renew our contract.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the bait,\u201d <i>Swinton grumbled. </i>\u201cHere comes the switch. If I don\u2019t impress now, they\u2019ll be a lot less coy next time around.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHowever,\u201d Eunectes hissed.</i></p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThere is a concern regarding output,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhile 150 square feet per month is certainly ideal for maintaining demand, we must be able to accommodate at least ten times that amount for\u2026extraordinary circumstances. There are hisses of the Empress taking an interest in Mammalian products; therefore we must be prepared to fulfill any outrageous demand. Can you be relied upon to oblige her potential appetites?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Swinton smirked and flipped a switch on the wall, the lights in the long hallway snapped on in sequence, revealing row after row of cells. \u201cThere are five more wings like this one in the building. At present, we are operating at 1% capacity. With a nearby shelter providing quick, easy access to resources, each one of those cells should be full by the end of the year. I hope your Empress likes fur.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eunectes hissed appreciatively, her beady, lidless eyes glittered in the florescent lights.</i></p><p><i>Back out in the parking lot, Swinton was accompanying Eunectes and her smaller guard out of the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus will stay and oversee the project in my stead,\u201d Eunectes said. \u201cI hope that is not too great an imposition.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Swinton said, shaking her head. \u201cHe will bring a certain respectability and elegance to the place, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmm,\u201d Eunectes said, nodding appreciatively. \u201cI must say, Mayor Swinton, it is rare to meet a Mammal with so many admirable traits as yourself. I am pleased to resume business with you.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAdmirable traits,\u201d<i> Swinton scoffed.</i> \u201cNo doubt she\u2019s referring to my casual disregard for the stock in there. Not many people know this, but willful cruelty is a distinctly Mammalian trait. Reptiles, on the other hand, simply have no regard for the wellbeing of others; they have no need to inflict pointless cruelty. Typically, they see our social interactions as quaint at best, and as obstructions of business at worst. My disregard for the stock as people but my good treatment of them as product has no doubt left a good impression.\u201d <i>She turned and smiled, laughing airily. \u201cOh, why thank you, Ambassador! Might I say that I find your taste in business partners to be flawless! Also, that headdress, that\u2019s gold, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Eunectes. \u201c24 karat gold. Hand crafted.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that\u2013\u201d Swinton began to say before a thunderous bellow cut through the air.</i></p><p><i>She spun around to see the other crocodile guard streak towards a dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. He flung the heavy steel dumpster through the air as though it were a cardboard box, there was a loud clacking sound as his jaws snapped shut. The huge crocodile shambled over, stopping in front of Swinton. He stooped over and spat a tiny, trembling mass at her feet.</i></p><p><i>Swinton did her best to not appear surprised. \u201cBobby, is that you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA-a-a-a-a-aaaaah\u2026\u201d the little, shivering feline stammered.</i></p><p><i>\u201cEnough of that,\u201d Swinton commanded, offering her hand. \u201cStand up, Bobby.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He rose to his feet, his eyes were huge inky pools lined with green. \u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe is with you?\u201d Eunectes crooned as she slithered forward to examine the child.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d Swinton said, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s from an at-risk children\u2019s home that I have in my debt. Every so often I have the children make deliveries for me. Isn\u2019t that right, Bobby?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMuh-mew-m-medicine,\u201d Bobby stuttered, unshouldering his backpack.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh yes, the \u2018medicine\u2019. For the stock, you see,\u201d Swinton clarified. \u201cTo keep them placid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmmmmm\u2026\u201d Eunectes cooed, bringing her head very close to the terrified child. \u201cOh, but I do love children, although I could never finish a whole one.\u201d She chuckled softly as Bobby went stiff with terror, as though galvanized. \u201cSo I content myself with but a taste.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her large, bruise-purple tongue flicked out and dabbed Bobby\u2019s cheek, the light flick of contact enough to make him squirm away.</i></p><p><i>Swinton rolled her eyes and gave him a pat on the rump. \u201cWell? Are you just going to stand and gawk all day? Get the medicine inside and leave out back.

And now, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re probably wondering \u2018where are we? Where are we going?\u2019 That\u2019s not my problem. You just wait and see. Trust me, you\u2019re going to love this.\u201d</p><p><i>The Pullman pulled up to a large, spacious-looking building surrounded by slum apartments and a few greasy spoons. Waiting on the steps of the building was a nervous-looking marmot; he was wearing a hardhat and high-visibility vest, just like he had been instructed to.</i></p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him, his name is Marshal\u2026something, I didn\u2019t bother to remember,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stepped out of the Pullman. </i>\u201cHe\u2019s quite good at what he does, and cheap, too. Though, I suppose one hundred thousand a year, tax-free, is better than whatever crumbs he was getting before at the mental institution. The clientele are similar, too.\u201d</p><p><i>She looked up at Marshal as she walked up the steps. \u201cThis had better be good, Marshal!

She wouldn\u2019t leave when I asked her to, said I had to get you to talk to her.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cOh,\u201d Swinton stepped back.</i> \u201cMarshal\u2019s a good boy. He has a good head for this business, very discreet.\u201d <i>She leaned back in, a winning smile on her face. \u201cYou did the right thing, Marshal, that\u2019s definitely not a name I want uttered on my phone, where anyone could be listening. Expect a raise at the end of the month.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d Marshal stammered, bowing his head and handing her a hardhat. \u201cThis way, Ma\u2019am.\u201d</i></p><p><i>She walked through the huge main hall of the building, long tables stretched from one end to the other in massive lines, with seating and accommodations for mammals of all sizes. The heavy, chemical smell of fresh paint hung in the air, mingling with the scent of sawdust and drywall. It was the newest building this side of Pack Street by at least twenty years.</i> \u201cA homeless shelter, in case you were wondering. <i>The </i>homeless shelter, in fact. The largest, most accommodating, most well funded shelter in the city! It has it\u2019s own trust fund and everything. When it opens next week, it\u2019ll be able to hold nearly five hundred medium-sized mammals. The filth flows in and flows back out, when there\u2019s that many of them, who\u2019s going to miss one or two here and there? Confused? Follow me, then. Don\u2019t dawdle.\u201d</p><p><i>Swinton and Marshal entered the kitchen area and walked into the massive refrigerator. Marshal reached down and pried open the drain grate; he reached down into the hole and pulled the release cable within. There was a clunk and the floor rose up before falling away, the tiles parting to form stairs. They descended the stairs and came upon a set of rails that stretched off into a dark, sporadically lit tunnel. Marshal hopped onto a nearby tram and opened the door for her, he powered up the little platform as she seated herself.</i></p><p>\u201cNot the most stylish way to travel,\u201d <i>Swinton muttered, before smiling,</i> \u201cBut then, it wasn\u2019t meant for me, was it? In fact, most of the people who\u2019ll see this tunnel will have only a bike seat or vinyl covered transit bench for comparison. Still confused? Good. The surprise will make it better.\u201d</p><p><i>The tram squeaked to a stop at the foot of another set of concrete stairs. Swinton and Marshal ascended them and stepped into a hallway lined with cells, the plexiglass doors revealed rooms with simple toiletries and a sturdy-if- austere bunk. Many of the cells were empty, but some were not. Marshal tried his best to keep his eyes ahead, not looking at the vacant, forlorn eyes staring out at them as they walked by. Swinton had so such compunctions.</i></p><p>\u201cPart of being a responsible farmer is resource management,\u201d <i>Swinton said as she stopped to examine the stock, a thin, hollow-cheeked snow leopard dressed in nothing but a white hospital gown; her pale green eyes gazed back as she cowered away. </i>\u201cLike this. A new acquisition, but one of interest. Our customers will pay top dollar for her coat, but as is she\u2019s not in the best of shape, too thin, too fragile. We\u2019ll need to fatten her up before we shave her. It\u2019s the only compassionate option, you see.\u201d <i>Swinton turned to Marshal. \u201cThis one! She\u2019s a little thin, isn\u2019t she? I was in here not two weeks ago and she looks like she hasn\u2019t gained a pound!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal nodded and stepped forward, not looking at the captive. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2019am, but she won\u2019t eat; not a bite for days! We\u2019ll have to put her on an I.V. if this keeps up.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cMarshal. He\u2019s got a good head, but a soft heart,\u201d <i>Swinton grunted, turning back to Marshal. \u201cAn I.V will only keep her alive. We need her to be healthy and fat! Put her under and make her eat through a tube!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut Ma\u2019am\u2013!\u201d Marshal began.</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut what?!\u201d Swinton hissed. \u201cShe\u2019s a snow leopard! Dense, rich, thick fur in a naturally beautiful pattern! Do you have any idea how much the Reptilians will pay for a square foot of her pelt? Get her healthy again, then hook her on \u2018nip or something and withhold it until she eats. It\u2019s that simple!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Marshal blinked, his expression shocked, before he looked down at his feet and nodded. \u201cY-yes, Ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll get some nurses on it ASAP.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSee that you do,\u201d Swinton said, flicking her blonde hair out of her eyes as she resumed back down the hall. </i>\u201cSee what I have to work with here? Honestly, it\u2019s like I have to do everything myself!\u201d</p><hr><p><i>Swinton stepped out into the parking lot outside the farm building, a large, abandoned-looking warehouse with boarded over windows and gang-tags scrawling the walls. She was assured somewhat by the high walls surrounding the lot that they would not be spied on. Swinton looked around, unconsciously sniffing the air. \u201cI\u2019m here now. You can come out of hiding.\u201d</i></p><p><i>There was a rustling sound followed by a dull electric keening, Swinton looked over to see a ripple and crease in the air, the image shimmered and distorted before retracting upwards, eventually revealing part of a large grey parasol that stretched to the ground. The parasol lifted up, beneath it a polished platinum-white metallic platform partially encased in an articulated, gold-plated dome. The platform was some five feet across and rolled forward on a single black sphere 1/3<sup>rd</sup> embedded in the bottom. The parasol folded and retreated further on its mechanical arm, finally disappearing into an ornately designed terrace that encircled the dome, save for an opening at the front. The dome clicked and opened partially, revealing a dark recess within. From the shadowy depths shone two glittering marbles atop a mass of dimly lustrous scales. A foot-long purplish tongue flicked out and tasted the air, followed by her massive, triangular head. Hidden within the rolling machine were the endless, overlapping coils of an exceptionally huge and imposing green anaconda, the visiting envoy from Herpetopia. Her scales we a dim and lustrous earthy green offset by the polished gold metal plates and technicolor feathers of her articulated headdress; truly, a regal creature.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAmbassador Eunectes,\u201d Swinton said, bowing shallowly to convey respect but not submission. \u201cTo what do I owe this unexpected visit?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNo special reason, Mayor Swinton,\u201d the enormous snake said, her voice was low and almost soothing in its gelid timbre, like a slow trickle of ice water. \u201cI merely wished to inspect the workings of our mutual business arrangement. Naturally, I must gauge the potential output of such a facility.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Swinton said, smirking as she looked aside.</i> \u201cRepulsive creatures, truly, but they make good business partners. See, walk a mammal through the farm and they\u2019re liable to fly into some kind of moral outrage. But a Reptile? Their first question would be \u2018do you charge by the square foot, or the square meter?\u2019 followed quickly by \u2018what is your projected annual output?\u2019 From there it\u2019s all about negotiation.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d Marshal said from behind. \u201cI tried to explain to her why she couldn\u2019t be here, but she refused to leave.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cBut, of course,\u201d Swinton said, not breaking eye-contact with Eunectes. \u201cYou\u2019re not talking to a Mammal, here, Marshal. You probably told her to leave and then tried to explain why. It doesn\u2019t matter how good of a reason you gave, you, as an inferior, issued orders to her, a highly venerated and respected member of the aristocracy; she was practically obliged to disregard your request.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cUh\u2013\u201d Marshal looked at his feet, confused.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYour groundskeeper stank of earth and moldy onions,\u201d Eunectes murmured, locking a glassy, predatory glare on the terrified marmot. \u201cInteresting that you would elect a farmhand to oversee this operation.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMarshal has an advanced skill set outside of his burgeoning talents in horticulture,\u201d Swinton countered, her tone carrying just the right amount of veiled conceit as to excite the Reptile\u2019s curiosity. \u201cHe\u2019s presently working on a\u2026 side-project. Cultivating exotic flora and the like.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cM-ma\u2019am!\u201d Marshal exclaimed, fidgeting nervously.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh!\u201d Swinton interrupted. \u201cGo inside and make sure our finest stock is on display. Prepare the samples and some refreshments for our guests.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cGuests?\u201d Marshal muttered. \u201cBut she\u2019s the only\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i>Two massive saltwater crocodiles stepped forward, their cloaks flickering as they attempted to emulate the change in surroundings; with a deliberate flair they pushed the chameleo-lattice back over their shoulders. They were intimidating specimens; reared up on their hind legs they must have been twelve feet tall if not a foot, and probably weighed upwards of two thousand pounds. Her guards stepped forward and uttered deep thunderous bellows; Marshal squeaked and scurried towards the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus!\u201d Swinton exclaimed, smiling toothily as she approached the larger of the two. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown since I last saw you. You\u2019ve been eating well, I trust?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMy former commander did not swim strongly enough,\u201d Porosus rumbled. \u201cThe current of the capitol pushed him into my jaws. My inheritance by him has seen me well fed this past year.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t guess it from looking at them, but Reptilians pride themselves on florid metaphors and wordplay in common conversation. Though brutal as a race, they see it as a sign of civility to cultivate an advanced vocabulary and wit.\u201d <i>Swinton chuckled and nodded respectfully. </i>\u201cMake no mistake, though, even metaphors can be deadly.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cI assume you have some questions, then, Ambassador?\u201d Swinton said, gesturing for them to follow.</i></p><p><i>They did, Swinton held open the door and took care to make her back was to them, as a sign of confidence in their mutual agreement.</i> \u201cAh, Reptilians. Older, wiser, much more advanced. If they were Mammals, they would have conquered the world by now! Luckily, their basic psychology prevents them from trusting one another long enough to do anything but hold onto what they have. They\u2019re intelligent, ruthless, self-absorbed, and intrinsically untrustworthy. Utterly predictable. The perfect business partners.\u201d</p><hr><p><i>\u201cAnd through here, you\u2019ll notice a few samples of our stock,\u201d Swinton said, gesturing at the five or so Mammals standing at attention in their cells. \u201cAs you can plainly see, they are healthy, well-fed, and meticulously groomed. Their fur should be ready for harvest within a week. After their fur is shaved and affixed to a sheet, the stock is sent to the care wing to recuperate while another lot is prepped for harvest.\u201d Swinton turned to her company. \u201cAt present, we can maintain an output of 150 square feet per month, and the best part is, it\u2019s renewable!\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIndeed, and the slow-growing crop yields the highest demand,\u201d Eunectes said, extending her thick body to examine one of the captives, a cowering coypu. \u201cFrom whence do these wretches come? I understand Mammals can find room in their hearts for many, who are these that their absence goes unheeded?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cVagrants and indigents, mostly,\u201d Swinton said, with a snort. \u201cThe homeless, the insane, the lazy. At least here they are of use to someone.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Eunectes cooed. \u201cSuch flaws in character and blood are not suffered in Herpetopia. Citizens flaunting such traits are recycled, as is their right as weaklings. That you have divined such a use for the detritus of your race speaks volumes of your business acumen. We will renew our contract.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the bait,\u201d <i>Swinton grumbled. </i>\u201cHere comes the switch. If I don\u2019t impress now, they\u2019ll be a lot less coy next time around.\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cHowever,\u201d Eunectes hissed.</i></p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p><i>\u201cThere is a concern regarding output,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhile 150 square feet per month is certainly ideal for maintaining demand, we must be able to accommodate at least ten times that amount for\u2026extraordinary circumstances. There are hisses of the Empress taking an interest in Mammalian products; therefore we must be prepared to fulfill any outrageous demand. Can you be relied upon to oblige her potential appetites?\u201d</i></p><p><i>Swinton smirked and flipped a switch on the wall, the lights in the long hallway snapped on in sequence, revealing row after row of cells. \u201cThere are five more wings like this one in the building. At present, we are operating at 1% capacity. With a nearby shelter providing quick, easy access to resources, each one of those cells should be full by the end of the year. I hope your Empress likes fur.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Eunectes hissed appreciatively, her beady, lidless eyes glittered in the florescent lights.</i></p><p><i>Back out in the parking lot, Swinton was accompanying Eunectes and her smaller guard out of the building.</i></p><p><i>\u201cPorosus will stay and oversee the project in my stead,\u201d Eunectes said. \u201cI hope that is not too great an imposition.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Swinton said, shaking her head. \u201cHe will bring a certain respectability and elegance to the place, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmm,\u201d Eunectes said, nodding appreciatively. \u201cI must say, Mayor Swinton, it is rare to meet a Mammal with so many admirable traits as yourself. I am pleased to resume business with you.\u201d</i></p><p>\u201cAdmirable traits,\u201d<i> Swinton scoffed.</i> \u201cNo doubt she\u2019s referring to my casual disregard for the stock in there. Not many people know this, but willful cruelty is a distinctly Mammalian trait. Reptiles, on the other hand, simply have no regard for the wellbeing of others; they have no need to inflict pointless cruelty. Typically, they see our social interactions as quaint at best, and as obstructions of business at worst. My disregard for the stock as people but my good treatment of them as product has no doubt left a good impression.\u201d <i>She turned and smiled, laughing airily. \u201cOh, why thank you, Ambassador! Might I say that I find your taste in business partners to be flawless! Also, that headdress, that\u2019s gold, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIndeed,\u201d said Eunectes. \u201c24 karat gold. Hand crafted.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cIs that\u2013\u201d Swinton began to say before a thunderous bellow cut through the air.</i></p><p><i>She spun around to see the other crocodile guard streak towards a dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. He flung the heavy steel dumpster through the air as though it were a cardboard box, there was a loud clacking sound as his jaws snapped shut. The huge crocodile shambled over, stopping in front of Swinton. He stooped over and spat a tiny, trembling mass at her feet.</i></p><p><i>Swinton did her best to not appear surprised. \u201cBobby, is that you?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cA-a-a-a-a-aaaaah\u2026\u201d the little, shivering feline stammered.</i></p><p><i>\u201cEnough of that,\u201d Swinton commanded, offering her hand. \u201cStand up, Bobby.\u201d</i></p><p><i>He rose to his feet, his eyes were huge inky pools lined with green. \u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cHe is with you?\u201d Eunectes crooned as she slithered forward to examine the child.</i></p><p><i>\u201cYes,\u201d Swinton said, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s from an at-risk children\u2019s home that I have in my debt. Every so often I have the children make deliveries for me. Isn\u2019t that right, Bobby?\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMuh-mew-m-medicine,\u201d Bobby stuttered, unshouldering his backpack.</i></p><p><i>\u201cAh yes, the \u2018medicine\u2019. For the stock, you see,\u201d Swinton clarified. \u201cTo keep them placid.\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cMmmmmm\u2026\u201d Eunectes cooed, bringing her head very close to the terrified child. \u201cOh, but I do love children, although I could never finish a whole one.\u201d She chuckled softly as Bobby went stiff with terror, as though galvanized. \u201cSo I content myself with but a taste.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Her large, bruise-purple tongue flicked out and dabbed Bobby\u2019s cheek, the light flick of contact enough to make him squirm away.</i></p><p><i>Swinton rolled her eyes and gave him a pat on the rump. \u201cWell? Are you just going to stand and gawk all day? Get the medicine inside and leave out back. Quickly, now, don\u2019t dawdle!\u201d</i></p><p><i>Bobby didn\u2019t need much convincing and scurried away in a hurry. Swinton sighed and turned back to Eunectes. \u201cOne must keep them busy, otherwise they get\u2013\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u201cSoft,\u201d Eunectes said, her tongue flicking out. \u201cVery soft. Thick, plush, downy.\u201d</i></p><p><i>Swinton glanced aside, a smile pulling at the sides of her mouth. </i>\u201cYou know what they say: if there\u2019s a market, make a product.\u201d</p></p>',content:'<p><h2><b><i>A Terrible Thirst</i></b></h2><p><i>The ice cubes clinked together in the Lalique crystal glass, the ambrosial scotch rippling and lightening as the chilled water mixed in.

Expect a raise at the end of the month.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Th-thank you!&rdquo; Marshal stammered, bowing his head and handing her a hardhat. &ldquo;This way, Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>She walked through the huge main hall of the building, long tables stretched from one end to the other in massive lines, with seating and accommodations for mammals of all sizes. The heavy, chemical smell of fresh paint hung in the air, mingling with the scent of sawdust and drywall. It was the newest building this side of Pack Street by at least twenty years.</i> &ldquo;A homeless shelter, in case you were wondering. <i>The </i>homeless shelter, in fact. The largest, most accommodating, most well funded shelter in the city! It has it&rsquo;s own trust fund and everything. When it opens next week, it&rsquo;ll be able to hold nearly five hundred medium-sized mammals. The filth flows in and flows back out, when there&rsquo;s that many of them, who&rsquo;s going to miss one or two here and there? Confused? Follow me, then. Don&rsquo;t dawdle.&rdquo;</p><p><i>Swinton and Marshal entered the kitchen area and walked into the massive refrigerator. Marshal reached down and pried open the drain grate; he reached down into the hole and pulled the release cable within. There was a clunk and the floor rose up before falling away, the tiles parting to form stairs. They descended the stairs and came upon a set of rails that stretched off into a dark, sporadically lit tunnel. Marshal hopped onto a nearby tram and opened the door for her, he powered up the little platform as she seated herself.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Not the most stylish way to travel,&rdquo; <i>Swinton muttered, before smiling,</i> &ldquo;But then, it wasn&rsquo;t meant for me, was it? In fact, most of the people who&rsquo;ll see this tunnel will have only a bike seat or vinyl covered transit bench for comparison. Still confused? Good. The surprise will make it better.&rdquo;</p><p><i>The tram squeaked to a stop at the foot of another set of concrete stairs. Swinton and Marshal ascended them and stepped into a hallway lined with cells, the plexiglass doors revealed rooms with simple toiletries and a sturdy-if- austere bunk. Many of the cells were empty, but some were not. Marshal tried his best to keep his eyes ahead, not looking at the vacant, forlorn eyes staring out at them as they walked by. Swinton had so such compunctions.</i></p><p>&ldquo;Part of being a responsible farmer is resource management,&rdquo; <i>Swinton said as she stopped to examine the stock, a thin, hollow-cheeked snow leopard dressed in nothing but a white hospital gown; her pale green eyes gazed back as she cowered away. </i>&ldquo;Like this. A new acquisition, but one of interest. Our customers will pay top dollar for her coat, but as is she&rsquo;s not in the best of shape, too thin, too fragile. We&rsquo;ll need to fatten her up before we shave her. It&rsquo;s the only compassionate option, you see.&rdquo; <i>Swinton turned to Marshal. &ldquo;This one! She&rsquo;s a little thin, isn&rsquo;t she? I was in here not two weeks ago and she looks like she hasn&rsquo;t gained a pound!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Marshal nodded and stepped forward, not looking at the captive. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Ma&rsquo;am, but she won&rsquo;t eat; not a bite for days! We&rsquo;ll have to put her on an I.V. if this keeps up.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Marshal. He&rsquo;s got a good head, but a soft heart,&rdquo; <i>Swinton grunted, turning back to Marshal. &ldquo;An I.V will only keep her alive. We need her to be healthy and fat! Put her under and make her eat through a tube!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But Ma&rsquo;am&ndash;!&rdquo; Marshal began.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But what?!&rdquo; Swinton hissed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a snow leopard! Dense, rich, thick fur in a naturally beautiful pattern! Do you have any idea how much the Reptilians will pay for a square foot of her pelt? Get her healthy again, then hook her on &lsquo;nip or something and withhold it until she eats. It&rsquo;s that simple!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Marshal blinked, his expression shocked, before he looked down at his feet and nodded. &ldquo;Y-yes, Ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll get some nurses on it ASAP.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;See that you do,&rdquo; Swinton said, flicking her blonde hair out of her eyes as she resumed back down the hall. </i>&ldquo;See what I have to work with here? Honestly, it&rsquo;s like I have to do everything myself!&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>Swinton stepped out into the parking lot outside the farm building, a large, abandoned-looking warehouse with boarded over windows and gang-tags scrawling the walls. She was assured somewhat by the high walls surrounding the lot that they would not be spied on. Swinton looked around, unconsciously sniffing the air. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now. You can come out of hiding.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>There was a rustling sound followed by a dull electric keening, Swinton looked over to see a ripple and crease in the air, the image shimmered and distorted before retracting upwards, eventually revealing part of a large grey parasol that stretched to the ground. The parasol lifted up, beneath it a polished platinum-white metallic platform partially encased in an articulated, gold-plated dome. The platform was some five feet across and rolled forward on a single black sphere 1/3<sup>rd</sup> embedded in the bottom. The parasol folded and retreated further on its mechanical arm, finally disappearing into an ornately designed terrace that encircled the dome, save for an opening at the front. The dome clicked and opened partially, revealing a dark recess within. From the shadowy depths shone two glittering marbles atop a mass of dimly lustrous scales. A foot-long purplish tongue flicked out and tasted the air, followed by her massive, triangular head. Hidden within the rolling machine were the endless, overlapping coils of an exceptionally huge and imposing green anaconda, the visiting envoy from Herpetopia. Her scales we a dim and lustrous earthy green offset by the polished gold metal plates and technicolor feathers of her articulated headdress; truly, a regal creature.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ambassador Eunectes,&rdquo; Swinton said, bowing shallowly to convey respect but not submission. &ldquo;To what do I owe this unexpected visit?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;No special reason, Mayor Swinton,&rdquo; the enormous snake said, her voice was low and almost soothing in its gelid timbre, like a slow trickle of ice water. &ldquo;I merely wished to inspect the workings of our mutual business arrangement. Naturally, I must gauge the potential output of such a facility.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; Swinton said, smirking as she looked aside.</i> &ldquo;Repulsive creatures, truly, but they make good business partners. See, walk a mammal through the farm and they&rsquo;re liable to fly into some kind of moral outrage. But a Reptile? Their first question would be &lsquo;do you charge by the square foot, or the square meter?&rsquo; followed quickly by &lsquo;what is your projected annual output?&rsquo; From there it&rsquo;s all about negotiation.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Marshal said from behind. &ldquo;I tried to explain to her why she couldn&rsquo;t be here, but she refused to leave.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;But, of course,&rdquo; Swinton said, not breaking eye-contact with Eunectes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not talking to a Mammal, here, Marshal. You probably told her to leave and then tried to explain why. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how good of a reason you gave, you, as an inferior, issued orders to her, a highly venerated and respected member of the aristocracy; she was practically obliged to disregard your request.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Uh&ndash;&rdquo; Marshal looked at his feet, confused.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Your groundskeeper stank of earth and moldy onions,&rdquo; Eunectes murmured, locking a glassy, predatory glare on the terrified marmot. &ldquo;Interesting that you would elect a farmhand to oversee this operation.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Marshal has an advanced skill set outside of his burgeoning talents in horticulture,&rdquo; Swinton countered, her tone carrying just the right amount of veiled conceit as to excite the Reptile&rsquo;s curiosity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s presently working on a&hellip; side-project. Cultivating exotic flora and the like.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;M-ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; Marshal exclaimed, fidgeting nervously.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Swinton interrupted. &ldquo;Go inside and make sure our finest stock is on display. Prepare the samples and some refreshments for our guests.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Guests?&rdquo; Marshal muttered. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s the only&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Two massive saltwater crocodiles stepped forward, their cloaks flickering as they attempted to emulate the change in surroundings; with a deliberate flair they pushed the chameleo-lattice back over their shoulders. They were intimidating specimens; reared up on their hind legs they must have been twelve feet tall if not a foot, and probably weighed upwards of two thousand pounds. Her guards stepped forward and uttered deep thunderous bellows; Marshal squeaked and scurried towards the building.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Porosus!&rdquo; Swinton exclaimed, smiling toothily as she approached the larger of the two. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown since I last saw you. You&rsquo;ve been eating well, I trust?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;My former commander did not swim strongly enough,&rdquo; Porosus rumbled. &ldquo;The current of the capitol pushed him into my jaws. My inheritance by him has seen me well fed this past year.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t guess it from looking at them, but Reptilians pride themselves on florid metaphors and wordplay in common conversation. Though brutal as a race, they see it as a sign of civility to cultivate an advanced vocabulary and wit.&rdquo; <i>Swinton chuckled and nodded respectfully. </i>&ldquo;Make no mistake, though, even metaphors can be deadly.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I assume you have some questions, then, Ambassador?&rdquo; Swinton said, gesturing for them to follow.</i></p><p><i>They did, Swinton held open the door and took care to make her back was to them, as a sign of confidence in their mutual agreement.</i> &ldquo;Ah, Reptilians. Older, wiser, much more advanced. If they were Mammals, they would have conquered the world by now! Luckily, their basic psychology prevents them from trusting one another long enough to do anything but hold onto what they have. They&rsquo;re intelligent, ruthless, self-absorbed, and intrinsically untrustworthy. Utterly predictable. The perfect business partners.&rdquo;</p><hr /><p><i>&ldquo;And through here, you&rsquo;ll notice a few samples of our stock,&rdquo; Swinton said, gesturing at the five or so Mammals standing at attention in their cells. &ldquo;As you can plainly see, they are healthy, well-fed, and meticulously groomed. Their fur should be ready for harvest within a week. After their fur is shaved and affixed to a sheet, the stock is sent to the care wing to recuperate while another lot is prepped for harvest.&rdquo; Swinton turned to her company. &ldquo;At present, we can maintain an output of 150 square feet per month, and the best part is, it&rsquo;s renewable!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Indeed, and the slow-growing crop yields the highest demand,&rdquo; Eunectes said, extending her thick body to examine one of the captives, a cowering coypu. &ldquo;From whence do these wretches come? I understand Mammals can find room in their hearts for many, who are these that their absence goes unheeded?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Vagrants and indigents, mostly,&rdquo; Swinton said, with a snort. &ldquo;The homeless, the insane, the lazy. At least here they are of use to someone.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Eunectes cooed. &ldquo;Such flaws in character and blood are not suffered in Herpetopia. Citizens flaunting such traits are recycled, as is their right as weaklings. That you have divined such a use for the detritus of your race speaks volumes of your business acumen. We will renew our contract.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bait,&rdquo; <i>Swinton grumbled. </i>&ldquo;Here comes the switch. If I don&rsquo;t impress now, they&rsquo;ll be a lot less coy next time around.&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Eunectes hissed.</i></p><p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;There is a concern regarding output,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;While 150 square feet per month is certainly ideal for maintaining demand, we must be able to accommodate at least ten times that amount for&hellip;extraordinary circumstances. There are hisses of the Empress taking an interest in Mammalian products; therefore we must be prepared to fulfill any outrageous demand. Can you be relied upon to oblige her potential appetites?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Swinton smirked and flipped a switch on the wall, the lights in the long hallway snapped on in sequence, revealing row after row of cells. &ldquo;There are five more wings like this one in the building. At present, we are operating at 1% capacity. With a nearby shelter providing quick, easy access to resources, each one of those cells should be full by the end of the year. I hope your Empress likes fur.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Eunectes hissed appreciatively, her beady, lidless eyes glittered in the florescent lights.</i></p><p><i>Back out in the parking lot, Swinton was accompanying Eunectes and her smaller guard out of the building.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Porosus will stay and oversee the project in my stead,&rdquo; Eunectes said. &ldquo;I hope that is not too great an imposition.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Swinton said, shaking her head. &ldquo;He will bring a certain respectability and elegance to the place, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mmm,&rdquo; Eunectes said, nodding appreciatively. &ldquo;I must say, Mayor Swinton, it is rare to meet a Mammal with so many admirable traits as yourself. I am pleased to resume business with you.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Admirable traits,&rdquo;<i> Swinton scoffed.</i> &ldquo;No doubt she&rsquo;s referring to my casual disregard for the stock in there. Not many people know this, but willful cruelty is a distinctly Mammalian trait. Reptiles, on the other hand, simply have no regard for the wellbeing of others; they have no need to inflict pointless cruelty. Typically, they see our social interactions as quaint at best, and as obstructions of business at worst. My disregard for the stock as people but my good treatment of them as product has no doubt left a good impression.&rdquo; <i>She turned and smiled, laughing airily. &ldquo;Oh, why thank you, Ambassador! Might I say that I find your taste in business partners to be flawless! Also, that headdress, that&rsquo;s gold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Eunectes. &ldquo;24 karat gold. Hand crafted.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Is that&ndash;&rdquo; Swinton began to say before a thunderous bellow cut through the air.</i></p><p><i>She spun around to see the other crocodile guard streak towards a dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. He flung the heavy steel dumpster through the air as though it were a cardboard box, there was a loud clacking sound as his jaws snapped shut. The huge crocodile shambled over, stopping in front of Swinton. He stooped over and spat a tiny, trembling mass at her feet.</i></p><p><i>Swinton did her best to not appear surprised. &ldquo;Bobby, is that you?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;A-a-a-a-a-aaaaah&hellip;&rdquo; the little, shivering feline stammered.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Enough of that,&rdquo; Swinton commanded, offering her hand. &ldquo;Stand up, Bobby.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>He rose to his feet, his eyes were huge inky pools lined with green. &ldquo;Uhhh&hellip;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;He is with you?&rdquo; Eunectes crooned as she slithered forward to examine the child.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Swinton said, patting him on the shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s from an at-risk children&rsquo;s home that I have in my debt. Every so often I have the children make deliveries for me. Isn&rsquo;t that right, Bobby?&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Muh-mew-m-medicine,&rdquo; Bobby stuttered, unshouldering his backpack.</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Ah yes, the &lsquo;medicine&rsquo;. For the stock, you see,&rdquo; Swinton clarified. &ldquo;To keep them placid.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Mmmmmm&hellip;&rdquo; Eunectes cooed, bringing her head very close to the terrified child. &ldquo;Oh, but I do love children, although I could never finish a whole one.&rdquo; She chuckled softly as Bobby went stiff with terror, as though galvanized. &ldquo;So I content myself with but a taste.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Her large, bruise-purple tongue flicked out and dabbed Bobby&rsquo;s cheek, the light flick of contact enough to make him squirm away.</i></p><p><i>Swinton rolled her eyes and gave him a pat on the rump. &ldquo;Well? Are you just going to stand and gawk all day? Get the medicine inside and leave out back. Quickly, now, don&rsquo;t dawdle!&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Bobby didn&rsquo;t need much convincing and scurried away in a hurry. Swinton sighed and turned back to Eunectes. &ldquo;One must keep them busy, otherwise they get&ndash;&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Soft,&rdquo; Eunectes said, her tongue flicking out. &ldquo;Very soft. Thick, plush, downy.&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>Swinton glanced aside, a smile pulling at the sides of her mouth. </i>&ldquo;You know what they say: if there&rsquo;s a market, make a product.&rdquo;</p></p>',content_abstract:'<p>\n\n<h2><b><i>A Terrible Thirst</i></b></h2>\n<p><i>The ice cubes clinked together in the Lalique crystal glass, the ambrosial scotch rippling and lightening as the chilled water mixed in.

I\u2019ll have to take this slow, let them feel safe, secure, and comfortable. And just when those precious little children finally have something valuable enough to lose, I ask for my favor. Down town, on skid row, I have my thumbs in a lot of different pies.

You&rsquo;ll notice that this chapter is more story-driven and much less emotionally charged than the others. Now that&rsquo;s partly because there&rsquo;s only so much you can do with &ldquo;Nick is old lonely and miserable for 20 panels&rdquo;, but I had In fact planned to finish the whole series without much in the way of storylines. </p><p>But as things have it I got some ideas for short stories like this. I was agonizing over whether to post this chapter at all, or just scrap it and finish up the AU series as originally planned (in 3 more comics). In the end though I decided I was having such a good time writing and drawing these that, even if they might end up harming the larger narrative, it would be a pity not to finish and share them. I figure there\u2019s still many of you that\u2019ll enjoy these even if they\u2019re not all crazy emotional, and, ant least sometimes, there\u2019s something to be said of quantity over quality.</p><p>Any <i>true </i>Zootopia aficionados will no doubt recognize Mayor Swinton, the planned villainess in proto-zootopia that was ultimately replaced by Dawn Bellwether. Less obsessed fans might still recognize officer Swinton, the pig lady from the DMV and jail guard during the credits sequence, which presumably was what became of the model asset Gisnep had made for the mayor. </p><p>Very little is known about the original mayor Swinton from the official material, aside from \u201cwears makeup&quot; and &ldquo;has a reflection in the mirror\u201d. So she&rsquo;s one of those cases where you have a &quot;canon&rdquo; character that&rsquo;s still an OC in all but name and design. Naturally, we made her into a Frank Underwood expy! \n\nI\u2019m very excited to tell that we\u2019re collaborating on a longer fic that will shed more light on the Swinton case!</p>',caption_abstract:"\n<h2><b>Chew Toy</b></h2>\n<p><i>\n\nThe phone rang; it was the low inoffensive bleating of an office line, meant to attract attention instead of demanding it.

I pull some strings and arrange for the Aardvard school building to go up for lease.

He shook his head and sat back down. Swinton laughed and clapped her hands. \u201cWonderful! I\u2019ll see to it that a lease is written up in your name. You should be cleared to move in by the end of the week! Maybe you can have the kids learn a thing or two from the contractors as they work on the restoration. A valuable skill!
